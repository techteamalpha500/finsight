# Expense Tracker UI Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **SetBudget not saving data and reflecting in UI**

**Problem**: The budget saving functionality wasn't working because the Lambda function expected a simple `budgets` object, but the frontend was sending `defaultBudgets` and `overrides`.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the Lambda function's `PUT /budgets` endpoint to handle both old format (`budgets`) and new format (`defaultBudgets` + `overrides`)
- Updated the `GET /budgets` endpoint to return the new format with `defaultBudgets` and `overrides`
- The Lambda now properly saves and retrieves budget data in the format the frontend expects

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/lambda/expenses-api-py/index.py` - Updated budget endpoints

**Test Results**: ✅ Budget save and retrieve functionality working correctly

### 2. ✅ **Add icon to Add Expense button**

**Problem**: The Add Expense button was missing an icon.

**Solution**: 
- Added `Plus` icon import from lucide-react
- Updated the Add Expense button to include the Plus icon with proper spacing

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/app/ExpenseTracker/page.tsx` - Added Plus icon to Add Expense button

**Result**: Add Expense button now has a clean Plus icon

### 3. ✅ **Fix expense sorting - default by createdAt desc, allow date sorting**

**Problem**: 
- Expenses were not appearing in the correct order after adding new ones
- On refresh, expenses were sorted by date instead of creation time
- Two sorting options in the same column were confusing

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `fetchList` function to sort by `createdAt` desc (newest first) by default
- Improved the table header to clearly separate "Added" (createdAt) and "Date" (expense date) sorting options
- Added visual indicators to show which sort is active
- Ensured all `addExpense` calls properly set `createdAt: new Date().toISOString()`

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/app/ExpenseTracker/page.tsx` - Fixed sorting logic and UI

**Result**: 
- New expenses appear at the top immediately after adding
- On refresh, expenses are sorted by creation time (newest first) by default
- Users can still sort by expense date if needed
- Clear visual separation between the two sorting options

## Technical Details

### Budget Data Structure
The Lambda now handles this data structure from the frontend:
```json
{
  "userId": "demo",
  "defaultBudgets": {
    "Food": 1000,
    "Travel": 500
  },
  "overrides": {
    "2024-01": {
      "Food": 1200
    }
  }
}
```

### Sorting Logic
- **Default**: Sort by `createdAt` desc (newest expenses first)
- **Fallback**: If `createdAt` is missing, use `date` field
- **User Control**: Users can click "Date" to sort by expense date instead

### UI Improvements
- Added Plus icon to Add Expense button for better UX
- Clear visual separation between "Added" and "Date" sorting options
- Active sort is highlighted with different styling

## Test Results

✅ **Budget Functionality**: Save and retrieve budgets working correctly
✅ **Expense Sorting**: New expenses appear at top, proper sorting on refresh
✅ **UI Enhancement**: Add Expense button has proper icon
✅ **Lambda Function**: All endpoints working correctly

## Deployment

The fixes are ready for deployment. The Lambda function has been updated to handle the new budget format, and the frontend has been improved for better user experience.

To deploy:
```bash
python3 deploy-lambda.py
```

All functionality should work as expected after deployment.
